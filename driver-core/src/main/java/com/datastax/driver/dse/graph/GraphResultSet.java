     * You can however call this method manually to force the fetching of the

     * strictly needed. For instance, if you want to prefetch the next page of

     * result set, you can do:
     * <pre>
     *   GraphResultSet rs = session.executeGraph(...);

     * This method is not blocking, so in the example above, the call to {@code
     * fetchMoreResults} will not block the processing of the 100 currently available
     * results (but {@code iter.hasNext()} will block once those results have been processed
     * until the fetch query returns, if it hasn't yet).
     * <p/>
     * Only one page of results (for a given result set) can be
     * fetched at any given time. If this method is called twice and the query
     * triggered by the first call has not returned yet when the second one is
     * performed, then the 2nd call will simply return a future on the currently
     * in progress query.
     *
     * @return a future on the completion of fetching the next page of results.
     * If the result set is already fully retrieved ({@code isFullyFetched() == true}),
     * then the returned future will return immediately, but not particular error will be
     * thrown (you should thus call {@code isFullyFetched() to know if calling this
